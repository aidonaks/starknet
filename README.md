# starknet

**Overview**

Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup) for Ethereum. It operates as a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation without compromising on Ethereumâ€™s composability and security.

Starknet achieves secure low cost transactions and high performance by using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Starknet contracts and the Starknet OS are written in Cairo, a custom-built and specialized programming language.

**What is this repository**

It's just some code I came up with for basic utilities written in Cairo to run on Starknet.** Everything here is work in progress.**
